Greetings, dear candidate,

Thanks for taking the time to do our front end challenges!

Please make sure to read all instructions thoroughly and with care. It would be a shame if you missed important parts of a challenge.

In general, what we'd like to see:

- **JavaScript.** Even though Elm might be more your type, we'd prefer to see your JavaScript skills. Same goes for CSS and HTML and their various preprocessors.
- **Modern code.** Outdated browser hacks aren't necessary for these challenges. Knowing how to work around the foibles of IE and Safari are important, but it's not a great use of your time right now. Unless otherwise stated, it only needs to work in latest Chrome and Firefox. As such, we'd like to see how well you know your modern JavaScript -- use all the HTML5 APIs and ES6 features you see fit.
- **Clean code.** Keep it consistently formatted, with a nice balance of comments and self-documenting code. Only write the sort of code you'd like to maintain. Sure, there might be a super clever one liner you could use, but if it's too hard to understand, a more verbose response might be better.
- **Your skills.** We haven't provided libraries in any of the three challenges included here. We feel that what we've supplied, combined with your own coding prowess, should be enough to complete the challenge. That being said, sometimes there is a good case for bringing in some third party code, but if you do, use your judgment and explain why you used an external library.

All submissions are reviewed anonymously, so please don't include your name or any other identifying information within the code (including generated files, such as package.json) and any notes you submit. A zip of the code rather than a git repository is also preferable for the same reason.

Good luck, we hope you have fun!
